      <h3>Why is encryption important?</h3>
      <p>
        Encryption is important because it protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, keeping data secure. 
        It ensures privacy in communication, preventing hackers or third parties from intercepting personal or confidential messages.
         Governments, businesses, 
        and individuals rely on encryption to safeguard financial transactions, personal data, and sensitive information from cyber threats.
        <br>
        
        
        Encryption plays a vital role in securing different types of IT assets and personally identifiable information (PII). 
        To this end, encryption serves four essential functions:
        <br>
        <br/>
        Encryption has long been used to protect sensitive information. 
        Historically, it was used by militaries and governments. In modern times, encryption is used to protect data both at rest and in motion.
         At-rest data is the type stored on computers and storage devices. In-motion data refers to data in transit between devices and over networks.

      </p>
    

      <h3>Can encryption be misused?</h3>
      <p>
        Encryption these days presents an uncompromising defense of increasingly higher levels of encryption (i.e.,
         no access to encrypted information to anybody including companies managing the data,
         device manufacturers, or even government entities) as the only way in which we can protect ourselves against the unwarranted 
         invasion of privacy from governments, social media platform providers, and other private companies we engage with. 
         <br>
         <br/>

        While motivated by well-documented and repeated cases in which these players have abused their ability to gain access to our 
        data and use it to their benefit, this approach may end up backfiring because it indirectly and unintentionally facilitates the abuse
        of encryption

      <h3> -- End-to-end encryption in messaging and its significance--</h3>
      <p>
        End-to-end encryption has emerged as a solution to protect the sanctity of these communications. 
        With this form of encryption, messages are encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the receiver's end.

      <h3>Discussion on real-life ethical concerns about encryption</h3>
      <p>
        Technology has changed our world. Privacy is important, but so is safety. Finding a balance between them is challenging.  
        Governments create laws to protect privacy while also making laws to bypass privacy controls for security.
        Technology and related laws are still developing. 
        Over time, both will evolve to find a balance between privacy, safety, and ethics worldwide.
        <br>
        <br/>

The use of encryption is effective in securing data and helping to protect the privacy of
information (Santos, Gummadi, Rodrigues, 2009). Encryption is a valuable tool for
protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information and when applied ethically is used
to protect information such as personal, financial, and proprietary data. Conversely, it does
create some challenges when used for unethical and illegal means, such as criminal or
terrorist activity. An example of this was the case in the 2015 San Bernardino shootings,
where the terror suspects phone was protected by encryption and law enforcement were not
initially able to gain access to the phone (Thomas, 2016). More recently, encryption is used to
conduct ransomware campaigns where threat actors encrypt an organisations data and
demand money in return for the decryption key. Without the key, decrypting data is
extremely difficult and time consuming. In addition, there may be safeguards that are
designed to protect techniques such as guessing the key (brute forcing) such as automatic
deletion of the data .
<br>
<br/>
Issues could arise when there are conflicts between laws, regulation, and cultural norms. This
area becomes complex, especially in cross border situations and what one may see as ethical,
another may not.

      </p>
      
        
      

      <p>Encryption is a necessity; without it, many of the modern technological processes on which we rely would not be possible.
         Web browsing would be less safe; online shopping would be out of the question. Subscription TV wouldn’t exist. Cryptocurrencies wouldn’t 
         exist. Encrypted chat wouldn’t exist.
      We accept that encryption allows users (a user could be an individual or a government) to secure information. 
      

       <br>
       <br/>
        
        Morally, the right to privacy is a basic human right, and as more of our lives becomes digital,
         there clearly needs to be a process in place to ensure our privacy in the digital space. Legally, it is more complicated:
          it is commonly argued that if one user’s right to privacy endangers another user, then it may be acceptable to restrict 
          or remove the former’s right to privacy, for the good of the latter.
